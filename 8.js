    term: "8.3 Filenames",
    definition: "The 8.3 filenames file-naming standard began with Microsoft DOS in 1981 and consisted of an eight-character ASCII name followed by a three-character file extension. Modern operating systems support long filenames, but MS Windows can also generate a short filename based on DOS 8.3 naming rules for compatibility with much older applications."
