    term: "Cell Phone",
    definition: "Cell phones are mobile devices that send and receive data and voice communications using base station transmitters, known as cells, which connect to cellular and telephone networks. Data communications are divided into bands with differing data transmission capabilities: 4G (LTE, up to about 150 Mbps) and 5G (up to 1 Gbps). Most cellular networks in the United States now offer 4G and 5G communications."

  {
    term: "Chip Set",
    definition: "A chip set communicates with components using controllers. Chip sets can also include \"integrated\" adapters for video, sound, and network connections. Chip sets placed close to the CPU are referred to as northbridge chip sets. Chip sets further away on the board, or located at the perimeter of the board, are referred to as southbridge."

  },
  {
    term: "Cooling Device",
    definition: "Cooling devices dissipate the heat that CPUs generate. This heat can damage the processor or chip. Generally, CPUs include a heatsink consisting of a metal block with fins and a fan. A thermal compound applied at the contact point between the chip and the heatsink helps heat transfer. Most computers also include one or more fans that route heated air out of the case. Modern motherboards have temperature sensors that warn of overheating before damage can occur. Large computing systems and performance PCs may require liquid cooling. Active cooling systems use electricity. Passive cooling systems do not require electricity."
