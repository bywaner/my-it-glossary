  },
  {
    term: "Random Access Memory (RAM)",
    definition: "RAM is the principal storage space for computer data and program instructions. RAM is described as volatile because it is temporary, meaning the data is only retained while the computer is in use."

    term: "Resolution",
    definition: "A digital image is made up of many thousands of picture elements (pixels). Resolution describes the number of dots an imaging device can use to sample or display the image, measured in pixels per inch (PPI). The higher the resolution, the better the quality. On a digital printer, the resolution is the number of toner or ink dots that the print engine can put on paper (measured in dots per inch [dpi]). Note that sometimes dpi is used interchangeably with PPI to describe scanner or monitor resolution. Still, image pixels and printer dots are not equivalent, as multiple printer dots are required to represent a single image pixel accurately."
  },
  {
    term: "Router",
    definition: "Routers connect similar and dissimilar networks at network layer three within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Routers can access multiple source and destination addresses within packets based on speed, traffic loads, and costs. They can keep track of multiple active paths within a source and destination network. Network administrators can use TCP/IP routers on a local area network to divide the network into logical subnets."
